                <p>Born in 1985 in Edinburgh, my artistic journey began not with a paintbrush, but with a forgotten typewriter. For years, writing remained the core of my expression, detailing the shifting landscapes of urban life and the quiet dramas of human connection. (First paragraph of life story)</p>

I began translating the rugged texture of my poems into oil and acrylic, finding that the two forms—text and canvas—spoke to each other. (Second paragraph of life story)</p>
                
                <p>Today, my work focuses on exploring the contrast between rigid structure and organic chaos, whether through the rhythm of a short story or the harsh lines of a landscape painting. I currently live and work in Melbourne, Australia. (Conclusion)</p>
