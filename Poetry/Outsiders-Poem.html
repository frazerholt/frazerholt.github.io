Words o' wit I have written for all my mental unfits
those who found bliss wagered no risk for death's kiss. It's
my slit-wristed misfits with a fetish for all distance,
those who paint with pink mist in their final instance,

Chance to ease the pain, let the goop and grey leak from the brain,
numb like novocaine who fain lost tears in the rain.
Peeps subsist in vain counting between sheep and days a gain,
again finding existence slain by the insane.

Hume or me not for want to attack the social contract,
off the rails on the train tracks and the k racks.
Words to relate, soul-paid devil dates are saved for Saturdays,
life decays the way a memory fades away.

Forgotten with a bullet shot and pools of blood wet snot,
Purps with skin rot purple spots from the hangmans knot.
No fools with falling tear drops popping pills for those forgot,
bottoms of bottels, thots, shots, 4, lamb with the lot.

A laughter so sacrilegious, forearms getting stitches,
jumping off bridges are figures got their wishes.
Homies who OD'D on codeine are hanging in alt scenes,
feins of dreams, edgy teens, mileage on their ripped jeans.

OG has-beens are put down on the whole for a bogey,
for poets known for being mopey overly.
Artist's who cause furore cast self-doubt lobotomies,
those seeing lowly got their freedom found to be.
