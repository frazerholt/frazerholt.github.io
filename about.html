                <h2>My Life and Work</h2>
                <p>Born in 1985 in Edinburgh, my artistic journey began not with a paintbrush, but with a forgotten typewriter. For years, writing remained the core of my expression, detailing the shifting landscapes of urban life and the quiet dramas of human connection.</p>
                
                <p>It wasn't until a move to the coast in 2010 that visual art took hold. The sudden shift from city grit to ocean light forced a different kind of observation. I began translating the rugged texture of my poems into oil and acrylic, finding that the two forms—text and canvas—spoke to each other.</p>
                
                <p>Today, my work focuses on exploring the contrast between rigid structure and organic chaos, whether through the rhythm of a short story or the harsh lines of a landscape painting. I currently live and work in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
